# sql-challenge

## Background
It is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

## Description
#### Data Modeling 
Inspected CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables. See HP_Employee_ERD.png. 

#### Data Engineering 
Created a table schema for each of the six CSV files, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. See schema.sql.

#### Data Analysis
Used SQL to analyze employee data. See queries.sql.git
